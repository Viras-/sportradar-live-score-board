I've started by using empty class implementations for building my test-suite(s).

Once my test-suite was finished I started implementing functionality until we reached all green.

During development, I've added some more tests if I needed an extra implementation which I did not anticipate when starting.

As this is typescript based, a simple npm i && npm test will install & execute all tests.
